title: lower limb prosthetics
description:  Contributed to the development of a modular, adjustable transtibial prosthetic designed for growing users. The system uses interchangeable parts to allow easy resizing and replacement as the user grows, improving long-term comfort and reducing the need for full prosthetic replacements. I supported designing cad model, testing and evaluation of the design, focusing on fit, durability, and user comfort.
