title: Ultrsound Imaging Analysis
description:  Worked on ultrasound imaging methods that use tiny gas-filled microbubbles to visualize blood flow in very small vessels around tumors. These microbubbles respond to ultrasound in unique ways, which makes it possible to see differences between healthy tissue and tumors based on their blood vessel patterns. I helped develop a MATLAB script to track tumor motion during imaging, keep the region of interest aligned over time, and extract quantitative data from the images. This analysis supports tumor detection and helps evaluate how well treatments that target blood vessel growth are working.
